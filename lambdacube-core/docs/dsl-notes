construction of images:
    - dimensions are of type V2U@C, i.e. they need to be constant during a pipeline execution, but can be otherwise configured
    - framebuffer constraint: all images must have the same dimensions (effectively the same node after hashconsing)
    - image constructor separate from semantics (only added when composing them into framebuffers), and containing contents instead of just a fill colour
